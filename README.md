# wipro_big_integer

This Project is for Custom BigInteger class

This class handles creation of BigInteger Objects

This class handles addition of Objects

This class handles subtraction of Objects

after adding/subtracting the values, the result will be stored in a custom cache
default size of cache is kept 10

as cache only stores the results of operation, so if duplicate result will come, then it will just consider the element is least recently used and will not allow a new duplicate element
